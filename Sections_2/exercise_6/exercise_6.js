//? Exercise: Arrays
// For this exercise, your task is to push two new numbers onto the existing numbers array: 8 and 2, in that order.

// Don't create a new array, don't overwrite the existing array - instead manipulate the existing array as taught earlier in the course.

function solve() {
  numbers.push(...[8, 2]);
}
